This blog post consists of the notes and summary from the book called *What Color is Your Parachute?*

### Chapter 2

**Cover letter** - make it personal and specific to the job you are applying for. 

### Chapter 3

##### You are not as powerless as you think. 

If you're currently out of work, and looking for a job, you have every reason in the world to think you are up against overwhelming forces and the situation you face is rather hopeless. You may have struck out, again and again. The media is always filled with bad news, about the unemployed, since 2008. But the situation you face is not hopeless.

So it is, that in any situation you find yourself, no matter how overwhelmed you may feel, no matter how much you may feel you're at the mercy of huge forces that are beyond your control, some part of it is within your control: maybe 2%, 5%, who knows? There is always something you can work on. Something that is within your power. And often, chaing that little bit results in changing a whole lot. 

what employer wants, matters. But what you want, matters. 

### Chapter 4 - Tips About Interviewing for a Job

- When hiring is tight, you will want to concentrate on small firms, and newer firms. 

- **An interview should be prepared for, before you ever go in.** Natually, you wanted to go into the interview with the employer curious to know more about you, but the employer is first of all curious about what you know about them. Don't skip this step. 

- **Honor agreement**. If they grant you the interview, keep to this commitment as though yout life depend on it. 

- **Questions you can expect from them, questions you can ask.**

  ***What experience, skills, or knowledge do you have, that are relevant to the job I am trying to fill?***

  In the length of time it takes to ride an elevator up a tall building, you should be able to say your entire answer to this question, rehearsed and rehearsed, <u>until you could say it in your sleep.</u>

  - **Tell me about yourself. (Of course.)**
  - **What do you know about this company?**
  - **Why are you applying for this job?**
  - **How would you describe yourself?**
  - **What are your major strengths?**
  - **What is your greatest weakness?**
  - **What type of work do you like to do best?**
  - **What are your interests outside of work?**
  - **What accomplishment gave you the greatest satisfaction?**
  - **Why did you leave your last job?**
  - **Why were you fired (if you were)?**
  - **Where do you see yourself five years from now?**
  - **What are your goals in life?**
  - **How much did you make at your last job?**

  But really there are only five basic questions that you need pay attenton to: 

  - **"Why are you here?" This means,"Why are you knocking on my door, rather than someone else's door?"**
