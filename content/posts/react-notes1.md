# Basics of React

###### (Most of the materials come from  [React Official Document](https://reactjs.org/docs/))

### JSX Represents Objects 

Babel compiles JSX down to `React.createElement()` calls.

These two examples are identical:

```jsx
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

`React.createElement()` performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this:

```react
// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

## Rendering Elements

### Rendering an Element into the DOM 

```html
<div id="root"></div>
```

```react
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
```

### Updating the Rendered Element 

React elements are [immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object). Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or  attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents  the UI at a certain point in time.

With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to `ReactDOM.render()`.

Consider this ticking clock example:

```jsx
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

It calls `ReactDOM.render()` every second from a [`setInterval()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) callback.

## Components and Props

 [Detailed component API reference goes here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html).

JavaScript function:

```jsx
// prefer this method 
// function component
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

```jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}
```

The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.

## Rendering a Component 

Elements can also represent user-defined components:

```jsx
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" /> //<.../> if component doesn't have any children, then can close like this
```

When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it  passes JSX attributes to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”.

For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Let’s recap what happens in this example:

1. We call `ReactDOM.render()` with the `` element.
2. React calls the `Welcome` component with `{name: 'Sara'}` as the props.
3. Our `Welcome` component returns a `Hello, Sara` element as the result.
4. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match `Hello, Sara`.

**Note:** Always start component names with a **capital letter.**

React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM **tags**.



## Composing Components 

For example, we can create an `App` component that renders `Welcome` many times:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Extracting Components 

Split components into smaller components: consider this `Comment` component:

```jsx
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
            /> 
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This component *<u>can be tricky to change because of all the nesting,  and it is also hard to reuse individual parts</u>* of it. 

```jsx
function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    />
  );
}
```

We recommend **naming props from the component’s own point of view** rather than the context in which it is being used.

```react
function UserInfo(props){
    return (
    <div className = "UserInfo">
        <Avatar user={props.user} /> 
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
            {props.user.name} 
            </div>
        </div>
    );
};
```

Then the `comment` gets simplified:

```jsx
function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} /> //pass  in a user props 
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props are Read-Only 

Whether you declare a component [as a function or a class](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components), it must never modify its own props. Consider this `sum` function:

```jsx
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Such functions are called [“pure”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs.

In contrast, this function is **impure** because it changes its own input:

```jsx
// this is not recommended in react 
function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}
```

React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:

**All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.**

## State and Lifecycle

Consider the `tick` example mentioned above, we will now learn how to make the `Clock` component truly reusable and encapsulated.

```jsx
function Clock(props){
    return(
      <div>
          <h1>Hello World!</h1>
          <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
}
function tick(){
    ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />, document.getElementById('root')
    );
}
```

## Converting a Function to a Class 

You can convert a function component like `Clock` to a class in five steps:

1. Create an [ES6 class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), that extends `React.Component`. 
2. Add a single empty method to it called `render()`.
3. Move the body of the function into the `render()` method.
4. Replace `props` with `this.props` in the `render()` body.
5. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

```jsx
//react.component already has lots of lifecycle functions
class Clock extends React.Component { // doesn't need (props), but it will need props as a member in the class
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2> 
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

But at this moment the function only a single instance of the `Clock` will be used. Will need to do the following: 

## Adding Local State to a Class 

State that contains in the component is called local state.

We will move the `date` from props to state in three steps:

1. Replace `this.props.date` with `this.state.date` in the `render()` method:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2> //use states instead of props, and will assign states later, since props is read-only and state is mutable so we could make changes, as time is suppose to changes in this component. 
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

2. Add a [class constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor) that assigns the initial `this.state`:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
    //Note how we pass `props` to the base constructor:
  constructor(props) { //do some initialization here 
    super(props);	// to inherent props from React.Component
      //date is a state
    this.state = {date: new Date()}; //Date() is a global variable       
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2> //toLocaleTimeString() is a member function of Date()
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Class components should always call the base constructor with `props` first.

3. Remove the `date` prop from the `<Clock />` element, and the code looks like this:

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />, //since Clock is a class now instead of a function 
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Next, we’ll make the `Clock` set up its own timer and update itself every second.



## Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class 

We want to [set up a timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval) whenever the `Clock` is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “**mounting**” in React.  (0->1)

We also want to [clear that timer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/clearInterval) whenever the DOM produced by the `Clock` is removed. This is called “**unmounting**” in React.

![](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/ogimage.201804100050.png)

We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts: These methods are called “**lifecycle methods**”.

The `componentDidMount()` method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:

```jsx
  componentDidMount() { //is where you can load data 
      //we save the timer ID right on `this` (`this.timerID`).
    this.timerID = setInterval( //two params, first is a function, second is 1000
      this.tick(),1000);
  }
```

```jsx
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }
```

Finally, we will implement a method called `tick()` that the `Clock` component will run every second.

It will use `this.setState()` to schedule updates to the component local state, and now the clock ticks every second.

```jsx
class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),// will call tick() every second
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```



Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:

1. When `<Clock />` is passed to `ReactDOM.render()`, React calls the **constructor** of the `Clock` component. Since `Clock` needs to display the current time, it initializes `this.state` with an object including the current time. We will later update this state.

2. React then calls the `Clock` component’s `render()` method. This is how React learns <u>what should be displayed</u> on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the `Clock`’s render output.

3. When the `Clock` output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the `componentDidMount()` **lifecycle** method. Inside it, the `Clock` component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s `tick()` method once a second. 

4. Every second the browser calls the `tick()` method. Inside it, the `Clock` component schedules a UI update by calling `setState()` with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the `setState()` call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the `render()` method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, `this.state.date` in the `render()` method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.

5. If the `Clock` component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the `componentWillUnmount()` lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.

   Use a `if...else` statement to check if the clock component is removed from the DOM.

## Using State Correctly 

There are three things you should know about `setState()`.

### Do Not Modify State Directly 

For example, this will not re-render a component:

```jsx
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
```

**WARNING**: The only place where you can assign `this.state` is the **constructor.**

```react
// Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'});
```



### State Updates May Be Asynchronous 

React may batch multiple `setState()` calls into a single update for performance.

Because `this.props` and `this.state` may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state.

For example, this code may fail to update the counter:

```jsx
// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});
```



```jsx
// Correct
// That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument:
this.setState((state, props) => ({// these two are pre-props
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
}));
```



```jsx
// Correct, this is equivalent as the previous one
this.setState(function(state, props) { 
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
});
```





### State Updates are Merged 

```jsx
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { // state contains several independent variables:
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  }
```

```jsx
  //you can update them independently with separate `setState()` calls:
componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts
      });
    });

    fetchComments().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments
      });
    });
  }
```

The merging is shallow, so `this.setState({comments})` leaves `this.state.posts` intact, but completely replaces `this.state.comments`.

### **state or prop**?

1. Check if this variable is getable via props from the Father components? If yes, then it is not a state. 
2. Check if this variable is not changing in the whole lifecycle in the component, if yes, then it is not a state. 
3. Is this variable could be calculated via other state or props? If yes, then it is not a state. 
4. Could this variable be used in `render()`? If so, then it is not a state.
