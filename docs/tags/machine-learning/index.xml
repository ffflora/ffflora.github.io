      <description>Data Engineering   In Kinesis Data Stream, number_of_shards = max (incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB/1000, outgoing_read_bandwidth_in_KB/2000)
where
incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB = average_data_size_in_KB multiplied by the number_of_records_per_seconds.
outgoing_read_bandwidth_in_KB = incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB multiplied by the number_of_consumers.
  Glue cannot write the output in RecordIO-Protobuf format. Lambda is not suited for long-running processes such as the task of transforming 1TB data into RecordIO-Protobuf format. Kinesis Firehose is not meant to be used for batch processing use cases and it cannot write data in RecorIO-Protobuf format.</description>

      <description>These are my study notes directly from AWS Training cource - AWS Machine Learning Exam Readiness.
Domain 1: Data Engineering Create Data Repo for Machine Learning Identify and implement a data ingestion solution To use the data for ML, you need to ingest it into a service like Amazon S3
Batch and stream processing are two kinds of data ingestion.
Batch processing Batch processing periodically collects and groups source data.With batch processing, the ingestion layer periodically collects and groups source data and sends it to a destination like Amazon S3.</description>
