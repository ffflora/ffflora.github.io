      <description>Smart Table Design Here are some very broad steps for creating new tables:  Pick the one thing you want your table to describe. Make a list of the information you need to know about that one thing when you are using the table. Using the list, break down the information about your thing into pieces you can use for organizing your table.  And here are some rules of atomic data, which should be the most important part of your table.</description>

      <description>ML Implementation and Operation   Inference Pipeline can be considered as an Amazon SageMaker model that you can use to make either real-time predictions or to process batch transforms directly without any external preprocessing.
  You can use Inference Pipeline to package Spark and scikit-learn based preprocessors into containers:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/inference-pipeline-mleap-scikit-learn-containers.html
  An inference pipeline is a Amazon SageMaker model that is composed of a linear sequence of two to fifteen containers that process requests for inferences on data.</description>

      <description>Modeling   Object2Vec can be used to find semantically similar objects such as questions. BlazingText Word2Vec can only find semantically similar words.
  mode is the mandatory hyperparameter for both the Word2Vec (unsupervised) and Text Classification (supervised) modes of the SageMaker BlazingText algorithm.
  Incremental Training in Amazon SageMaker
Over time, you might find that a model generates inference that are not as good as they were in the past.</description>

      <description>Exploratory Data Analysis   In case of a binary classification model with strongly unbalanced classes, we need to over-sample from the minority class, collect more training data for the minority class and create more samples using algorithms such as SMOTE which effectively uses a k-nearest neighbours approach to exclude members of the majority class while in a similar way creating synthetic examples of a minority class. Over-sampling from the positive class or collecting more training data for the positive class would further aggravate the situation.</description>

      <description>Data Engineering   In Kinesis Data Stream, number_of_shards = max (incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB/1000, outgoing_read_bandwidth_in_KB/2000)
where
incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB = average_data_size_in_KB multiplied by the number_of_records_per_seconds.
outgoing_read_bandwidth_in_KB = incoming_write_bandwidth_in_KB multiplied by the number_of_consumers.
  Glue cannotwrite the output in RecordIO-Protobuf format. Lambda is not suited for long-running processes such as the task of transforming 1TB data into RecordIO-Protobuf format. Kinesis Firehose is not meant to be used for batch processing use cases and it cannot write data in RecorIO-Protobuf format.</description>

      <description>These are my study notes directly from AWS Training cource - AWS Machine Learning Exam Readiness.
Domain 1: Data Engineering Create Data Repo for Machine Learning Identify and implement a data ingestion solution To use the data for ML, you need to ingest it into a service like Amazon S3
Batch and stream processing are two kinds of data ingestion.
Batch processing Batch processing periodically collects and groups source data.With batch processing, the ingestion layer periodically collects and groups source data and sends it to a destination like Amazon S3.</description>

      <description>The challenges identified in many data analysis solutions can be summarized by five key challenges: volume, velocity, variety, veracity, and value.
Volume - Data Storage  Structured(10%) data is organized and stored in the form of values that are grouped into rows and columns of a table. Semistructured(10%) data is often stored in a series of key-value pairs that are grouped into elements within a file. Unstructured(80%) data is not structured in a consistent way.</description>

      <description>SELECT SELECT DISTINCT vend_id FROM Vendors LIMIT 5; LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5; // return 5 results start from line 5 ORDER BY  This should be the last clause after the SELECT statement. It is legal to ORDER BY the columns that are not being selected. Default is ordering from A - Z, if descending, need to add DESC in the end. DESC only works on col name that listed in front.</description>

      <description>Auto-completion gcloud interactive has auto prompting for commands and flags, and displays inline help snippets in the lower section as the command is typed.
Static information, like command and sub-command names, and flag names and enumerated flag values, are auto-completed using dropdown menus.
Install the beta components:
