<p>A data engineer needs to create a <strong>cost-effective</strong> data pipeline solution that ingests <strong>unstructured data from various sources</strong> and stores it for downstream analytics applications and ML. The solution should include a data store <strong>where the processed data is highly available for at least one year</strong>, so that data analysts and data scientists can run analytics and ML workloads on the most recent data. For compliance reasons, the solution should include both processed and raw data. The raw data does not need to be accessed regularly, but when needed, should be <strong>accessible within 24 hours.</strong></p>

<p>A team of data scientists in a company focusing on security and smart home devices created an ML model that can classify guest types at a front door using a video doorbell. The team is getting an accuracy of 96.23% on the validation dataset.</p>
<p>However, when the team tested this model in production, images were classified with a much lower accuracy. That was due to weather: The changing seasons had an impact on the quality of production images.</p>
<p>What can the team do to improve their model?</p>

<p>A team of data scientists in a financial company wants to predict the risk for their incoming customer loan applications. The team has decided to do this by applying the <strong>XGBoost</strong> algorithm, which will predict the probability that a customer will default on a loan. In order to create this solution, the team wants to first <strong>merge the customer application data with demographic and location data</strong> before feeding it into the model.</p>

<p>Amazon <strong>SageMaker</strong> provides a few built-in algorithms that work for <strong>classification</strong> situations: <strong>Linear Learner, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors.</strong> <strong>XGBoost</strong>, for instance, is an open-source implementation of the gradient-boosted trees algorithm. <strong>Gradient boosting is a supervised learning algorithm that attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining an ensemble of estimates from a set of simpler, weaker models.</strong></p>
<p>In terms of the built-in Amazon <strong>SageMaker</strong> algorithms you could choose for <strong>regression problems</strong>, it’s pretty similar. Again, you could choose <strong>Linear Learner and XGBoost.</strong> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The difference is that you set the hyperparameters to direct these algorithms to produce quantitative results.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>

<li>Image classification is a supervised learning algorithm used to classify images.</li>
<li>Object detection algorithm detects and classifies objects in images using a single deep neural network. It is a supervised learning algorithm that takes images as input and identifies all instances of objects within the image scene.

<p>Sage Maker</p>
<h3 id="34-perform-hyperparameter-optimization"><strong>3.4: Perform hyperparameter optimization</strong></h3>
<h4 id="what-are-hyperparameters"><strong>What are hyperparameters?</strong></h4>
<p>Hyperparameters are the knobs or settings that can be tuned before running a training job to control the behavior of an ML algorithm. They can have a big impact on model training as it relates to training time, model convergence, and model accuracy. Unlike model parameters that are derived from the training job, the values of hyperparameters do not change during the training.</p>
<h4 id="there-are-different-categories-of-hyperparameters"><strong>There are different categories of hyperparameters</strong></h4>
<h5 id="model-hyperparameters">Model hyperparameters</h5>
<p>Model hyperparameters define the model itself—Attributes of a neural network architecture like filter size, pooling, stride, padding</p>
<h5 id="optimizer-hyperparameters">Optimizer hyperparameters</h5>
<p>Optimizer hyperparameters, are related to how the model learn the patterns based on data and are used for a neural network model. These types of hyperparameters include optimizers like gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent, or even optimizers using momentum like Adam or initializing the parameter weights using methods like Xavier initialization or He initialization</p>
<h5 id="data-hyperparameters">Data hyperparameters</h5>
<p>Data hyperparameters are related to the attributes of the data, often used when you don’t have enough data or enough variation in data—Data augmentation techniques like cropping, resizing</p>
<h4 id="tuning-hyperparameters-can-be-very-labor-intensive"><strong>Tuning hyperparameters can be very labor-intensive</strong></h4>
<p>Traditionally, this was done <strong>manually</strong>: someone who has domain experience related to that hyperparameter and the use case would manually select the hyperparameters based on their intuition and experience. Then they would train the model and score it on the validation data. This process would be repeated over and over again until satisfactory results are achieved.</p>
<p><strong>A better way  is to use search methods to tune hyperparameters</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Grid search and Random search</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ffflora/data-science-notes/blob/master/archived-pics/aws/image-20210124232631210.png?raw=true" alt="image-20210124232631210"></p>
<ul>
<li>Grid Search: you can set up a grid made of hyperparams and their different values. For each possible combination, a model is trained and a score is produced on the validation data. With this approach, every single combination of the given possible hyperparams values is tried. Therefore this method could be very inefficient.</li>
<li>Random Search: similar to grid search, but random combinations are selected. You can set the number of search iterations based on time and resource constrains.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="aws-solution-sagemaker">AWS Solution: SageMaker</h4>
<p>Then there’s automated hyperparameter tuning, which uses methods like gradient descent, Bayesian optimization, and evolutionary algorithms to conduct a guided search for the best hyperparameter settings.</p>

<h4 id="high-availability-and-fault-tolerance"><strong>High availability and fault tolerance</strong></h4>
<p>At the heart of designing for failure are two concepts known as high availability and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>In a highly available solution, the system will continue to function even when any component of the architecture stops working. A key aspect of high availability is fault tolerance, which, when built into an architecture, ensures that applications will continue to function without degradation in performance, despite the complete failure of any component of the architecture.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h4 id="one-method-of-achieving-high-availability-and-fault-tolerance-is-loose-coupling"><strong>One method of achieving high availability and fault tolerance is loose coupling</strong></h4>
<p>With a loosely coupled, distributed system, the failure of one component can be managed in between your application tiers so that the faults do not spread beyond that single point. Loose coupling is often <strong>achieved by making sure application components are independent of each other</strong>. For example, you should always decouple your storage layer with your compute layer because a training job only requires minimal time, but storing data is permanent. Decoupling helps turn off the compute resources when they are not needed.</p>

<p>AWS CloudTrail captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify.

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->You should decouple your ETL process from the ML pipeline. The compute power needed for ML isn’t the same as what you’d need for an ETL process—they have very different requirements.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>An ETL process needs to read in files from multiple formats, transform them as needed, and then write them back to a persistent storage. Keep in mind that reading and writing takes a lot of memory and disk I/O, so when you decouple your ETL process, <strong>use a framework like Apache Spark</strong>, which can handle large amounts of data easily for ETL.</li>
<li>Training, on the other hand, may require GPUs which are much more suited to handle the training requirements than CPUs. However, GPUs are less cost-effective to keep running when a model is not being trained. <strong>So you can make use of this decoupled architecture by simply using an ETL service like AWS Glue or Amazon EMR, which use Apache Spark for your ETL jobs and Amazon SageMaker to train, test, and deploy your models.</strong></li>

<h5 id="ams-sagemaker-endpoints">AMS SageMaker Endpoints</h5>
<p>To ensure a highly available ML serving endpoint, deploy Amazon SageMaker endpoints backed by multiple instances across Availability Zones.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h5 id="ams-sagemaker">AMS SageMaker</h5>
<p>Amazon SageMaker makes it easy to containerize ML models for both training and inference. In doing so, you can create ML models made up of loosely coupled, distributed services that can be placed on any number of platforms, or close to the data that the applications are analyzing.</p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/ffflora/data-science-notes/blob/master/archived-pics/aws/image-20210125170039194.png?raw=true" alt="image-20210125170039194"></p>
<h5 id="aws-auto-scaling">AWS Auto Scaling</h5>
<p>Use AWS Auto Scaling <strong>to build scalable solutions by configuring automatic scaling</strong> for the AWS resources such as Amazon SageMaker endpoints that are part of your application in response to the changes in traffic to your application.</p>
<p>With AWS Auto Scaling, you configure and manage scaling for your resources through a scaling plan. The scaling plan uses dynamic scaling and predictive scaling to automatically scale your application’s resources.</p>
<p><strong>This ensures that you add the required computing power to handle the load</strong> on your application, and <strong>then remove it when it&rsquo;s no longer required</strong>. The scaling plan lets you choose scaling strategies to define how to optimize your resource utilization. You can optimize for availability, for cost, or a balance of both.</p>
<p>As you increase the number of concurrent prediction requests, at some point the endpoint responds more slowly and eventually errors out for some requests. Automatically scaling the endpoint avoids these problems and improves prediction throughput. When the endpoint scales out, Amazon SageMaker automatically spreads instances across multiple Availability Zones. This provides Availability Zone-level fault tolerance and protects from an individual instance failure.</p>
<p>If the endpoint has only a moderate load, you can run it on a single instance and still get good performance. Use automatic scaling to ensure high availability during traffic fluctuations without having to constantly provision for peak traffic. For production workloads, use at least two instances. Because Amazon SageMaker automatically spreads the endpoint instances across multiple Availability Zones, a minimum of two instances ensures high availability and provides individual fault tolerance.</p>
<p><strong>To determine the scaling policy for automatic scaling in Amazon SageMaker, test for how much load (RPS) the endpoint can sustain. Then configure automatic scaling and observe how the model behaves when it scales out. Expected behavior is lower latency and fewer or no errors with automatic scaling.</strong></p>

<p>The bottom tier of the stack is for expert ML practitioners who work at the framework level. To work with these frameworks, you are comfortable building, training, tuning, and deploying ML models on the metal, so to speak. ML frameworks are the foundation from which innovation in ML is designed. The focus here is on making it easier for you to connect more broadly to the AWS ecosystem, whether that’s about pulling in IoT data from AWS IOT Greengrass, accessing state-of-the art chips (P3), or leveraging elastic inference.</p>
<p><strong>The vast majority of deep learning and ML in the cloud is done on P3 instances in AWS</strong>. You can use whichever ML deep learning framework you like, but some popular options are TensorFlow, MXNet, and PyTorch, which are all supported on AWS.</p>

<ul>
<li>Apply software engineering disciplines. Add error recovery code and make sure that tests for unexpected data inputs exist. Perform the same kind of unit testing, quality assurance, and user acceptance testing that is performed for other systems. If the ML system has moved from the research stage to development, some of these expected software engineering practices might have been inconsistently applied. Automate this system using common DevOps tools like AWS CodeBuild and AWS CodeCommit.</li>
<li>Track, identify, and account for changes in data sources. The data might change over time. One change in data type in one source can break the whole pipeline. Changes in software that produces a data source can have flow-on effects.</li>
<li>Perform ongoing monitoring and evaluation of results. Evaluate the expectations versus the results of the ML system. Build methods to check the error rate and the classes of errors being made against project expectations. If the overall error rate is the same, are the same proportions of the different classes of errors still the same? Is model drift occurring?</li>
<li>Create methods to collect data from production inferences that can be used to improve future models.</li>
